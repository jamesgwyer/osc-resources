# Occupational Specialism Exam resources

The 67 hour exam/project allows students access to the internet, so I don't think there will be a problem with this (especially not since it's on Github).

This README has most of the info, but some other stuff *might* be on [jamesgwyer.github.io/osc-resources](https://jamesgwyer.github.io/osc-resources).

## Task 1

> Produce a detailed proposal (and design documents) for the digital solution required by the client.

### Creating a business proposal

Proposal needs to include:
- a rationale
- functional and non-functional requirements of your solution
- a full list of the problems that need to be solved to meet all the requirements
- key performance indicators (KPI's) and user acceptance criteria for the proposed solution
- a full description of the proposed solution



## Task 2

> Develop a functional prototype of your digital solution.

**I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP A MOBILE APP, SO HERE'S A WEBSITE** (although you can create an app if you like??)

### Getting a database to work

The mark scheme for Task 2 says that students need to "implement front-end and back-end processes using at least two coding languages". Those two languages are (unfortunately) Python and HTML.

Here's an example [REDACTED] made: [db_example](https://github.com/jamesgwyer/osc-resources/tree/main/db_example).

#### Visual Studio Code extensions you need

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python" target="_blank">Python</a></li>

</ul>

#### File Structure

<pre>

├─ app.py
├─ my_database.db
├─ templates/
│  ├─ index.html
</pre>

### Templates to make website look nice

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://startbootstrap.com" target="_blank">startbootstrap.com</a> - templates using Bootstrap CSS framework</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank">html5up.net</a></li>
</ul>

## Task 3a

> Gather and record feedback for your digital solution.



## Task 3b

> Explain how your solution meets the clients requirements and talk through the design solution and recommend ways it could be further developed.
