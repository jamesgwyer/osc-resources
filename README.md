# Occupational Specialism Exam cheat sheet
This small site is a more portable version of [my Occupational Specialism summary](https://college.notes.jamesgwyer.com/summaries/occupational-specialism) on [college.notes.jamesgwyer.com](https://college.notes.jamesgwyer.com) (with a few extra bits to make life easier).

The 67 hour exam/project allows students access to the internet, so I don't think there will be a problem with this.
